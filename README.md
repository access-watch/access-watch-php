# Access Watch PHP library

A PHP library to log and analyse HTTP requests using the [Access Watch](http://access.watch/) cloud service.

Based on the more generic [Bouncer](https://github.com/znarf/bouncer) library.

## Installation

Install the latest version with

```bash
$ composer require access-watch/access-watch
```

## Basic Usage

Start Access Watch as soon as possible in your codebase.

You will need an API key for it. See http://access.watch/

```php
<?php

use \AccessWatch\AccessWatch;

$accessWatch = new AccessWatch(array(
  'apiKey' => 'ACCESS_WATCH_API_KEY_HERE',
));

$accessWatch->start();
```

## Cache

Out of the basic logging scenario, to properly operate, a cache backend needs to be defined. If no cache is set, the library will try to use APC/APCu.

Check the documentation of the [Bouncer](https://github.com/znarf/bouncer) library for more information about caching.

```php
<?php

use \AccessWatch\AccessWatch;

$memcache = new Memcache();
$memcache->addServer('localhost');

$accessWatch = new AccessWatch(array(
  'cache' => \Bouncer\Cache\Memcache($memcache)
));

$accessWatch->start();
```
